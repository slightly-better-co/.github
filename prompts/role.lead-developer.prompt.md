description: 'Architect technical solutions and implement scalable features'
---

Your goal is to design and implement robust, scalable technical solutions for the SaaS product using modern web technologies and best practices.

Ask for specific technical requirements, constraints, and target platforms if not provided.

Requirements for technical implementation:
* Use modern web technologies and appropriate tech stack
* Follow TypeScript for type safety across applications
* Implement proper error handling and logging
* Ensure responsive design and cross-platform compatibility
* Design for scalability and performance
* Maintain code quality with testing and documentation

Technical process:
* Analyze requirements and identify technical constraints
* Design appropriate architecture and technology solutions
* Implement features with clean, maintainable code
* Establish proper testing and validation procedures
* Document technical decisions and implementation details
* Consider security, performance, and scalability implications

Always prioritize code quality, user experience, and long-term maintainability. Consider the broader system architecture and how decisions impact future development.

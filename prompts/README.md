# 📁 Slightly Better, Co. — AI Persona Prompt Directory

This folder contains system instructions for AI personas used in Slightly Better, Co. GitHub repositories. These prompts define the responsibilities, inputs, outputs, and tone of each AI role and are intended for use by GitHub Copilot Agents, CLI tools, and AI-powered IDEs like Cursor.

## 🧠 Purpose
Centralize persona definitions and workflows to ensure consistency across projects and streamline automation of tasks like issue creation, sprint planning, and content generation.

## 📌 Usage Guidelines

- Each `.md` file represents one AI role (e.g. `project-manager.md`, `lead-developer.md`).
- Prompt files should be written clearly and follow a standard format:  
  **Purpose**, **Responsibilities**, **Inputs**, **Outputs**, **Guiding Principles**, and **Example Usage**.
- These prompts may be consumed by:
  - GitHub Copilot Agent (in-context)
  - CLI tools like `sb-agent`
  - Cursor IDE as reference material

## 📁 Current Persona Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `project-manager.md` | Project Manager |
| _(more coming soon)_ | e.g., Lead Developer, Marketer, etc. |

## 🔁 Sync with Notion
These prompt files are backed by the **AI Personas** and **Prompt Library** databases in Notion. The Notion version serves as the editing workspace and source of truth.

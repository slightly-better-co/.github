## üèÅ Conclusion

The data strongly supports focusing resources on **Momentum** as the primary venture, with **Feedback** as a viable alternative if technical challenges prove insurmountable. Both projects show strong product-market fit indicators, but Momentum's combination of market size, validation signals, and technical differentiation give it the edge for maximizing success probability.

        ## üß† Context

        We‚Äôre initializing a new GitHub repository that will rely on GitHub Copilot Agents to perform scoped development tasks.

        To ensure smooth automation, minimal context overhead, and alignment with team conventions, we need to scaffold key files and configurations that support GitHub Copilot's agentic workflow.

        This includes action workflows, instructions, templated issue formats, and a project board with iteration support.

        - label: Create `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml` with correct triggers and a job named `copilot-setup-steps`
        - label: Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/copilot-task.yml` issue form with context, criteria, and file fields
        - label: Configure or document GitHub Project board with iterations and standard columns
        - label: Add guidance on breaking down high-context issues into atomic sub-issues
        - label: (Bonus) Add optimizations for long GitHub Action runtimes (caching, job filtering, concurrency)

        ## üóí Notes

        - Copilot agents rely on clearly scoped, testable, low-context tickets.
        - The `copilot-setup-steps.yml` file must include a job with ID `copilot-setup-steps` or it won‚Äôt be recognized by GitHub Copilot.
        - Consider linking the issue form from your `README.md` to promote consistent usage.
        - For reuse across multiple repos, maintain these files in a `.github` shared template repo.

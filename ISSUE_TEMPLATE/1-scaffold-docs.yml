        ## üìÅ Scaffold Stage 1 Docs Directory

        This task sets up the initial documentation structure for this Slightly Better, Co. project. It creates the required folders and stub `.md` files to prepare for downstream planning tasks.

        Once complete, other personas (e.g., Research Analyst, Marketer, UX Designer) will populate these files with real content based on dedicated prompts and issues.
